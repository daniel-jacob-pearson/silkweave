- When a page is requested with a path that doesn't end in a slash, redirect to
  the same path with a slash appended. This should be done for reasons
  mentioned in the documentation for the "DirectorySlash" Apache configuration
  directive.
- See about integrating the software found at http://elrte.org/ to make a sort
