  - Started a changelog.
  - When a page is requested with a path that doesn't end in a slash, redirect
    to the same path with a slash appended. This allows relative URL
    references within the HTML code of pages to work correctly.
  - Template rendering exceptions are handled, as are most other exceptions.

  - Simplified Stitch::Utils#find_upward by a few lines.
  - Allow page type to be set on a page without bequeathing that type to the
    page's descendents by using "=page-type" instead of ":page-type".

Fri 17 Sep 2010
  - The pages returned by Stitch::PageTypes::Base#children now have paths that
    end with "/" to avoid unnecessary 301 responses when those paths are used
    to construct URLs in HTML output.
